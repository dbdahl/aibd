  1. Debugged discrepency between R and Scala implementation of
     logLikelihoodLGLFM.

  2. Made new tests in 'test-lglfm-likelihood.R' to provide:
      1. R and Scala give the same values for likelihood in LGLFM.
      2. R and Scala give the same values for posterior in LGLFM.

  1. Wrote the Scala implementation for MCMC from the IBP prior.  Access it by
     providing an X matrix with no columns to the function samplePosteriorLGLFM.

  2. Edits tests in 'test-ibp-sampling-matches-pmf.R' to provide:
      1. Sampling from IBP using constructive definition (from Scala) gives a
         distribution consistent with the pmf.
      2. Sampling from IBP using MCMC (from Scala) gives a distribution
         consistent with the pmf.
      3. Sampling from IBP using constructive definition (from R) gives a
         distribution consistent with the pmf.

  3. Warr has code the needs to be integrated and tested to implement:
      1. Sampling from IBP using MCMC (from R) gives a distribution consistent
         with the pmf.
    Specifically, this test needs to be uncommented after Warr modifies the
    function 'samplePosteriorLGLFM' to perform prior sampling when X matrix has
    no columns.

2019-02-26: Group meeting notes

  1. Assignments:

      1. Dahl
          1. Let Warr know where to save corrected landscape and portrait
             posters in Git repository.
          2. Scala implementation of MCMC sampling for IBP prior,  including
             adding tests.
          3. Scala implementation of MCMC sampling for the posterior of the
             linear Gaussian latent feature model (LGLFM) using the IBP prior,
             including adding tests.

      2. Warr
          1. Integrate code into the package to sampling from the IBP using
             MCMC (from R).  Specifically, modify the R implementation of the
             function 'samplePosteriorLGLFM' to perform prior sampling when X
             matrix has no columns.
          2. Enable tests for the implementation #1 above by uncommenting the
             lines at the bottom of 'test-ibp-sampling-matches-pmf.R'.
          3. Add R implementation in the function 'logPosteriorLGLFM' to
             provide MCMC sampling for the posterior of the linear Gaussian
             latent feature model (LGLFM) using the IBP prior.
          4. Commit the corrected landscape and portrait posters in Git
             repository.

      3. Meyers
          1. Copy 'test-ibp-sampling-matches-pmf.R' to
             'test-aibd-sampling-matches-pmf.R' and implement the tests:
              1. Sampling from AIBD using constructive definition (from Scala)
                 gives a distribution consistent with the pmf.
              2. Sampling from AIBD using constructive definition (from R)
                 gives a distribution consistent with the pmf.
