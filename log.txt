  * Debugged discrepency between R and Scala implementation of logLikelihoodLGLFM.
  * Made new tests in 'test-lglfm-likelihood.R' to provide:
      * R and Scala give the same values for likelihood in LGLFM.
      * R and Scala give the same values for posterior in LGLFM.

  * Wrote the Scala implementation for MCMC from the IBP prior.  Access it by providing an X matrix with no columns to the function 'samplePosteriorLGLFM'.
  * Edits tests in 'test-ibp-sampling-matches-pmf.R' to provide:
      * Sampling from IBP using constructive definition (from Scala) gives a distribution consistent with the pmf.
      * Sampling from IBP using MCMC (from Scala) gives a distribution consistent with the pmf.
      * Sampling from IBP using constructive definition (from R) gives a distribution consistent with the pmf.
  * Warr has code the needs to be integrated and tested to implement:
      * Sampling from IBP using MCMC (from R) gives a distribution consistent with the pmf.
    Specifically, this test needs to be uncommented after Warr modifies the function 'samplePosteriorLGLFM' to perform prior sampling when X matrix has no columns.
